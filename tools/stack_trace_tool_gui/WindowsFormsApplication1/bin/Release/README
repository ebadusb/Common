Inputs:

Enter name (including full path) of data log file or select file in File -> Open ... to browse for file.  Select version
2.02 for Trima and 2.20 for Optia. An optional build location can be supplied (include full path).  Paths to OSs (safety, 
apc, and control) can be also be optionally supplied in the ospaths field. In this case, relative paths from "current_build"
(a subdirectory of the build path) are desired, and should be delimited with commas and no spaces. Furthermore, they should
be sorted according to increasing node ID (currently, this is safety, apc, then control). Default values, as well as values
for -osfile, -alias, and -address options of the StackTrace tool can be placed in an associated file called "StackTrace.cfg",
to be placed in the same directory as the executable "StackTraceUI.exe". This file should follow the same format as shown in
"EXAMPLE.cfg", and can be used to define default values for data log file, build path, ospaths, version, osfile, alias, and
address.  E.g., to ensure version 2.20 is always checked when StackTraceUI runs, place "version=2.20" in config file. Refer
to the documentation of the StackTrace Tool for descriptions of osfile, alias, and address options.


Description:

The StackTrace GUI wraps the command line driven StackTrace Tool so that commonly used options need not be specified every
time, once a config file is written, and enables the use of a right click short cut from a dlog file. To enable the latter
situation, go into Tools -> Folder Options in My Computer and click on Advanced tab for DLOG file type and add new action 
using "<Path to StackTraceUI>\StackTraceUI.exe" "%L" and your choice of an action description (e.g., "Open with StackTraceUI")

4.0 Release Checklist
---------------------

. Evaluate status of the build_tools
    Gasper will update the guide.txt file with documentation for SCons

. Remove the www directory after moving from tigris
    Bill will do this

. Migrate tickets to SourceForge (or the final repository)
  Cleanup tickets that won't be resolved

. Resolve CxxTest project planning concerns
    Note: this doesn't directly affect the release process, but I think it affects the timing
    and planning of the release.

. Migrate CxxTest branches
    cxx_tests       - Testing files for FOG parser
    pythonrefactor  - Refactoring Python code

---- 4.1 Issues ----

. Change FOG parser to put temporary parsetab.py files someplace other than the current directory.
    Q: Can we assume that the user will have write-access to the cxxtest root directory?  I would
        guess NO, so perhaps this is a ticket for 4.1

. Add a CMAKE build harness
    This is a 4.1 ticket

. Add valgrind tests
    This is a 4.1 ticket

. Add static analyzer
    This is a 4.1 ticket

. Standardize test execution when linking static components together
    This is a 4.x ticket
